## Installation

There are different way to install this library:

1. Download the source code from github and compile yourself: **https://github.com/XeroAPI/Xero-Net**
2. Download directly into Visual Studio using the NuGet powershell command **PM&gt; Install-Package Xero.API.SDK.Minimal** to get a minimal installation.
3. Download directly into Visual Studio using the NuGet powershell command: **PM&gt; Install-Package Xero.API.SDK** to get a larger installation with sample token store using [SQLite](http://http://system.data.sqlite.org/).

##Things to note
* The library tries to do as little as possible and provides a basis to be extended. There are examples of TokenStores, Authenticators and Application types. These examples provide enough to get you going, but are not a complete solution to all your needs. You will need to adapt them for your own use and situation. Private application will work out of the box, as they do not have to deal with tokens and OAuth.
* The HTTP verbs are not used in the public part of the API. Create, Update and Find are used instead. This seperates the implementation from the the intent.
* Invoices and Contacts support pagination. In the RESTful API these are off by default. For the wrapper, they are always on and default to page 1. See the Counts or Creation code examples for how to use the Page method to get all items.
* Contacts support including archived contacts. Like the RESTful API, this if off by default. Use IncluceArchived(true) to include them.
* Payroll supports paging on all endpoints.
* Four decimal places are supported and are always on.
* You will need an instance of the API per organisation / connection. The connection is stored as part of the API instance.

## Samples
There are samples for each of the API endpoints. These have been done as console application and also a collection of NUnit tests. See the README for each of the executable and test assemblies. The test projects contain lots of useful examples of how to use this library to interact with the Xero API.

##Querying
There are simple filters on different endpoints.

* ModifiedSince
* Where
* Or
* And
* OrderBy
* OrderByDescending
* Page
* Offset

They are used in a [Fluent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) way, but are not LINQ. They simply create a query for the URL passed to the API. Nested queries are not handled using the syntax. Or and And need to come after a Where statement. OrderBy, OrderByDescending and Page can come anywhere.

	var invoices = xeroApi.Invoices  
		.ModifiedSince(new DateTime(2014, 1, 31))  
		.Where("Total > 3500.0")  
		.And("Total < 10000.0")  
		.Page(2)  
		.OrderByDescending("DueDate")  
		.Find();

The following gives the same query string to the API as the example above.

	var invoices = xeroApi.Invoices  
		.Page(2)  
		.OrderByDescending("DueDate")  
		.Where("Total > 3500.0")   
		.And("Total < 10000.0")  
		.ModifiedSince(new DateTime(2014, 1, 31))  
		.Find();
		
##Application types

There are specific classes for each of the application types. If these are used, you will need to have the app.config file settings for your organisation.

For a public application you would use
	
	var user = new ApiUser { Name = "The users name" };
    var tokenStore = new SqliteTokenStore();

    var api = new Applications.Public.Core(tokenStore, user)
    {
        UserAgent = "Something to show your application"
    };
	
The config file will look like this
	
    <add key="BaseUrl" value="https://api.xero.com"/>
    <add key="ConsumerKey" value="Your Key"/>
    <add key="ConsumerSecret" value="Your secret"/>
    <add key="CallbackUrl" value="Your callback"/>
	
There are classes for Private, Public and Partner applications for the Core Xero API and Australian and American Payrolls.

A private application will need to also populate

	<add key="SigningCertificate" value="Path to .pfx file"/>
    
A partner application will need to also populate

	<add key="SigningCertificate" value="Path to .pfx file"/>
	<add key="PartnerCertificate" value="Path to Xero issued Entrust certificate file"/>    

##Authenticators

The application classes all use implementations of IAuthenticator. See [PrivateAuthenticator](https://github.com/XeroAPI/Xero-Net/blob/master/Xero.Api.Example.Applications/Private/PrivateAuthenticator.cs) for an example. The authenticators are used by the base infrastructure to do the heavy lifting of the Xero API authentication.

###PrivateAuthenticator
Uses RSA-SHA1 and a public/private certificate. There are no tokens and each request has to be signed.

###PublicAuthenticator
Uses HMAC-SHA1 and the standard 3-legged [OAuth](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) process. Tokens last for 30 minutes and cannot be renewed.

###PartnerAuthenticator
Uses RSA-SHA1 and a Xero provider certificate and then the standard 3-legged [OAuth](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) process with an additional signing certificate. Tokens last for 30 minutes and be renewed. Token renewal is supported by this provider.

Examples for renewing your access tokens can be seen in the RenewToken method overrides in the PartnerAuthenticator.cs and PartnerMVCAuthenticator.cs classes.


###OAuth signing
All the signing is done by a slightly modified version of the Dust library provided by [Ben Biddington](https://github.com/ben-biddington/dust). Source is included.

##Token Stores
The token store implementations are separate and optional. (It is recommended that you do have a store.)

The interface ITokenStore has three methods.

	public interface ITokenStore
	{
		IConsumer Find(string user);
		void Add(IToken token);
		void Delete(IToken token);
	}

You can provide your own implementation to suit the database you are using for your product. Ensure the dates on the token are stored in UTC.

The examples are

* MemoryTokenStore - Dictionary of token in RAM keyed on UserId
* SqliteTokenStore - A database of tokens (file on local disk). This does not support multiple add-ons in the same database. The tokens are only for the application the database was created by.

##Serialization

All communication with the [Xero API](http://developer.xero.com) is compressed at source. Writing to the API is done with XML. The data model classes have be attributed to give a small XML payload. All communication back from the API is JSON. These details are transparent to the user of the class library.

##Usage
To get going quickly:

1. Follow this getting started guide: http://developer.xero.com/documentation/getting-started/getting-started-guide/
2. Create a console project and download the following package using the NuGet powershell command: PM> Install-Package Xero.API.SDK 
3. Use the snippets below depending on the type of application, modifying keys and certificate paths.

Note, remember to implement your own custom token store before going live. The examples provided in the library Xero.Api.Example.TokenStores.dll
are for development only.

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
			// Private Application Sample
			var private_app_api = new XeroCoreApi("https://api.xero.com", new PrivateAuthenticator(@"C:\Dev\your_public_privatekey.pfx"),
                new Consumer("your-consumer-key", "your-consumer-secret"), null,
                new DefaultMapper(), new DefaultMapper());
				
			var org = private_app_api.Organisation;
			
			var user = new ApiUser { Name = Environment.MachineName };

			// Public Application Sample
            var public_app_api = new XeroCoreApi("https://api.xero.com", new PublicAuthenticator("https://api.xero.com", "https://api.xero.com", "oob", 
				new MemoryTokenStore()),
                new Consumer("your-consumer-key", "your-consumer-secret"), user,
                new DefaultMapper(), new DefaultMapper());

            var public_contacts = public_app_api.Contacts.Find().ToList();
			
			// Partner Application Sample
			var partner_app_api = new XeroCoreApi("https://api-partner.network.xero.com", new PartnerAuthenticator("https://api-partner.network.xero.com",
                "https://api.xero.com", "oob", new MemoryTokenStore(),
                @"C:\Dev\your_public_privatekey.pfx", @"C:\Dev\your_entrust_cert.p12", "your_entrust_cert_password"),
                 new Consumer("your-consumer-key", "your-consumer-secret"), user,
                 new DefaultMapper(), new DefaultMapper());
				
			var partner_contacts = partner_app_api.Contacts.Find().ToList();			
        }
