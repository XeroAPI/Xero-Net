## Tests for the Core API
These are really code snippets in the form of runnable tests. The examples for each of the endpoints in [Developer](http://developer.xero.com/documentation/api/api-overview/) have been turned into individual tests.


## Getting the tests working

The config file will need to be edited for your certificate and token values for a private application.

These will run against the live API, so will cause your rates to be reached if all are run at once.
